## Mission Statement

I want to show that the internet can be a positive and useful place that supports the comprehension of one’s surroundings. I will do that by seeking synergies between my experience in computer science, my fascination for all things data, and my passion for culture and people. I will distill these into playful, helpful, or insightful software artifacts.

I work as a software engineer at <a href="https://eyeo.com">eyeo</a> in Cologne, Germany.
