I owe much more to this city than the following notes. But until time and writing skills allow me to properly pay tribute to Valencia, this will have to do.

## Getting from A to B
- Get EMT’s [Bonobús](https://www.emtvalencia.es/ciudadano/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=621&Itemid=66&lang=en#2) card for €8.50 and be done with it (you don’t need the [metro](https://www.metrovalencia.es/en/) to get around town)
	- You can use the card for multiple people, just make sure to swipe inside the bus accordingly
- Don’t get confused: bus stops are in Valencian
- Wave at an approaching bus that you want to take to make sure it stops and picks you up
- Rent bikes with [Valenbisi](https://www.valenbisi.es/en/home)
- Our personal guilty pleasure to get a feeling for a city: [the red hop-on-hop-off tourist bus](https://www.visitvalencia.com/en/shop/hop-on-hop-off-bus-tour/valencia-tourist-bus-tour) (not really a recommendation… we’ve had better)

## Neighborhoods
- Valencia is divided into 19 districts each of which is further divided into several quarters
- Ciutat Vella district: the medieval old town with most of Valencia’s iconic sights (e.g. the [cathedral](https://catedraldevalencia.es/), [Mercat Central](https://www.mercadocentralvalencia.es/), [San Nicolás](https://www.sannicolasvalencia.com/)) between [Jardín del Turia](https://jardins.valencia.es/es/jardin/jardin-del-turia-tramos-1-2-3) in the north (what an urbanistic masterpiece—kudos to everyone who helped turning a riverbed into a gigantic green belt) and the streets along the former city wall in the south
	- Two of the city wall’s twelve towers—Torres de Seranos and Torres de Quart—still exist and frame the quarter El Carmen, note-worthy for its bustling street art scene
	- If you need a place to stay, we had a great time at the [UNIK. Apartments](https://www.unikapartmentsvalencia.com/) in summer 2021
- The district L’Eixample with its super-trendy quarter Ruzafa: gentrification par excellence, but damn it is nice to get lost in the alleys, the pubs, the cafés, and the little shops
- Ciutat de les Arts i les Ciències/Quatre Carreras: what we called home for five weeks in summer 2022 and where my father-in-law lives, not far from the opera house (Palau de les Arts), the aquarium (L'Oceanogràfic), the science museum (Museu de les Ciències Príncipe Felipe), and so much more
- El Saler/Pobles del Sud: summer residence of my stepmother-in-law, with beautiful beaches, and the mesmerizing [L’Albulfera national park](http://albufera.valencia.es/en)

## Food and Drinks
Valencia and my wife have healed my FOMO when it comes to finding the perfect spot to dine. I could spend hours on Google Maps, read ratings, study menus, and look at photos. Now I am happy to drift through the city and stop off at any place that looks nice. I also managed to get rid of some long-lasting misconceptions: Plastic chairs and pictures on the menu are not indicators for bad food! A 3.5 star rating on Google Maps does not mean you’re gonna have a bad time!

Some places we stumbled upon:

- Restaurante Casa Toni: menú del día (appetizer + main course + bread + dessert/coffee) for €9, Toni is a sweetheart
- Bar Sabina Valencia: tapas, cañas, aceitunas at a busy intersection
- Olrait: menú del día for €11.50, the atún a la plancha and the brownie are delicious, great spot for hot weather as the outside area always seems to be windy
- Maestro Dōner Kebap: great Döner Kebab
- Sorsi e Morsi Cánovas: Italian restaurant with lovely staff, we celebrated my sister-in-law’s 23rd birthday here
- Cafè Sant Jaume: in the heart of the old town, a lot of shade, drinking water fountain nearby, perfect spot to people-watch, rest, and dwell on one’s thouyghts
- 100 Montaditos: A classic! Small sandwiches, snacks, drinks for super-cheap, one is always close
- Dodo’s Mediterrasian Restaurant: almuerzo (a meal at lunch time, but not lunch—that would be comida, more like a second breakfast) for €5 (in my case a huge bocadillo chivito + vino tinto de la casa)
- La Pepica: One of *the* traditional Paella restaurants, right at the city beach
- La Flaca de Ruzafa: cozy restaurant in the middle of Russafa
- …to be continued

If you spend enough time here and have a full-fledged kitchen at your disposal, go to Carrefour, buy some fresh seafood, and cook yourselves a nice meal. Valencia demands it!

And a short note on tipping: It is not common here to tip the waiters or bartenders. If the service was truly phenomenal, feel free to leave a couple of coins. But rounding up to include 10% on the amount-to-be-paid earned us some weird looks.

## Museums and Culture
Valencia is bursting with museums, culture, art, and music. I can only list a few highlights here because it is impossible to cover everything that this city has to offer. Also watch out for festivals ([Jazz](https://www.palauvalencia.com/va/jazz/programa/), [Film](https://ivc.gva.es/es/audiovisuales/programacion/filmoteca-estiu-cas), [Gran Fira](https://granfiravalencia.com/es)), concerts, and exhibitions—there is always something going on!

## Other Places
- [Cines Babel](http://www.cinesalbatrosbabel.com/), movies in original language with Spanish subtitles

- The narrowest house in Europe, Plaza Lope de Vega, 9: make sure to have some tapas in “La Estrecha” (“the narrow”) right next to it
- [Jardí Botànic](https://www.jardibotanic.org/): the botanical garden of Valencia university or how I call it, “peace and quiet inside a green oasis for €3”
